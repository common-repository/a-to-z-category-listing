== Description ==

This Plugin will show A-to-Z listing of all categories in alphabetical order. Use CSS style to decorate your index page. From admin settings You also can exclude some of the categories form the category listing.

I have not been able to test all the plugin's features on all combinations of WordPress versions, browsers, databases, and PHP versions, so some problems could remain on some of the many possible configurations. The best thing to do is just give it a try!
